Hugging Face is a vital platform for machine learning and AI tasks due to its robust workflows and extensive model repository. In this course, you'll first explore the basics of Hugging Face, including its components, available models, and datasets. You'll then unlock the potential of state-of-the-art transformers and frameworks for ML and AI tasks, starting with NLP. You'll discover essential pipelines and expand into tasks involving images and audio. The journey concludes with a focus on fine-tuning models and using embeddings for downstream tasks like searching.
